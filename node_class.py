Task 1 â€“ Nodes

The Node class should have:

Properties/Attributes
data -> the data stored in the node
next -> the pointer to the next item in the list

Methods
getData -> return the data
getNext -> return the pointer
setData -> change the stored data
setNext -> Change the pointer

Once you have created the Node class you need to be
able to test that it works. So before we move on write
some code to test that all of the methods you have
created work as you wanted.
